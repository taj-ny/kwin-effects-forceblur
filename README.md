A fork of [KWin](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/kwin) that allows the user to force-enable the blur effect on any window by settings the ``Force blur`` property in window settings.

For X11 use the [kwin-forceblur](https://github.com/esjeon/kwin-forceblur) script instead.

### Supported versions
- [5.27.10](https://github.com/taj-ny/kwin-forceblur-wayland/tree/v5.27.10) (coming soon)
